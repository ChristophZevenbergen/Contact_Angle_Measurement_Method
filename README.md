# ContactAngle_Measurement_Method
This library provides the code for a new automated contact angle measurement method for x-ray microtomographic images of two-phase flow in porous media.

This method computes the contact angle by fitting a plane to the rock-fluid interface and a sphere to the fluid-fluid interface. The angle formed between the plane and the sphere is the measured contact angle.

To check if the library is working, first run the scrip "Example_Measurements.py".  It includes the functions which do the measurements and gives a flag if the measurements are not equal to the values expected (similar to a test).
